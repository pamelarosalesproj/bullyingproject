Hi, my name is Hope and like many people today, I have been bullied.
My story began in the sixth grade, everything was perfect. I had a great group of friends,a few boys admired me and I was quite popular. After winning form captain against this girl who was called Isabelle. I thought the year was going to be fantastic.
Obviously, all this was too good to be true. I noticed Isabelle started commenting on pretty much everything about me. Meanly. I was getting tired of it and asked her to stop. What I didn't realize was that this started a major drama that impacted my ENTIRE life. Jess (Isabelle'd BFF,) heard me asking Isabelle to stop and told me to kill myself!
I was so dazed, but I just ignored it, I was fine, I had a group of friends that would stick by me.
OR SO I THOUGHT. The next year, my group of 'friends' started obsessing over boys. My 'best friend' Teneille, had a MAJOR crush on this boy who one day asked me out. When Teneille backstabbed me to hang out with Isabelle and Jess to get revenge, all the girls followed. Except for one. Cassidy. I was very afraid because I knew that the bigger the group. The worse the bullying could get. I received hate mail in class, I got glares, I was made fun of for my clothes. I was imitated, I was gossiped about. Goodness, I even had girls taking pictures of me in class to post online to have them all go on and call me names.
It was distressing and frightening and I cried. Lots. My parents had enough of the school doing nothing and me crying every day when I came home from school, that they pulled me out.
I have started at my new school and am so much happier. Although the girls from my old school still cross my path and try and ruin it for me at my new school, I am fine. I thank God everyday for helping me. I still cry about it though, It's been a year and I don't think i'll ever forget the pain.
