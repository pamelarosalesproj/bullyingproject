My name is Jay~Jay. I've been bullied since Pre-K. I always wore pants. Never dresses so everyone thought I was a boy. I could play sports and run when i got to elementary school.
They called me fat when I was in third grade. I was pulled out of school to become cyber schooled. It was great at first! Then I seen kids everywhere. They come over to me and call me names.
After 5th I went to school again. Everything was great until this one boy went around calling me a h**. Everyone believed him, I did nothing to even be one. I was called ugly. They would say I was 'Ratchet' I didn't wear Nikes or Jordan's. I wore Vans. I played basketball, most girls wouldn't. I was called a boy and I still am called a boy. I have very few friends but I know a lot of people. Just remember, Those words they call you, Aren't true because You're Beautiful
