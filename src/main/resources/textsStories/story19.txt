Hi my name is Marisela. I was bullied from 1st all the way to 5th grade. I'm in 11th grade now and i'm now 17, so it was a long time ago. But the scars from all those years of bullying are still there. I was a very quiet and shy kid so i guess that made me an easy target and i was treated pretty much like dirt. I should also mention my dad passed away when i was 6 and on top of that i was being bullied. When i got a little older i became depressed a lot and i never knew why. By the time i was 15 i realized i was feeling so depressed because i hadn't gotten over being bullied and i realized that i need to come to terms with that in order to move on with my life. You have to forgive because if you live with this hatred in our heart all your doing is hurting yourself. Forgiveness doesn't make what that person did to you right, forgiveness is for you so that you can move on and be happy. This process of forgiveness is something i'm still going through. I'm over the bullying for the most part but as for the people who hurt me its gonna take longer for me to forgive them for that. From my experience i've learned so much and its made me such a strong person. And i have to give a huge thanks to my family who love me unconditionally especially my mom she's everything to me. I've come a long way and my life is doing pretty good right now. If your being bullied please stay strong because life has so much in store for you and you won't want to miss out on it.
