Hello! My name is Jasmine.I like your website www.noplace4hate.org . I have never been bullied once because I go to a private school where bullying in NOT encouraged.. Well, actually... I was bullied once. I was friends with a girl named Natalie when I was about 9 and she had a older sister who absolutely hated me. We had the same lunch times and she would always say stuff like, "Your not good for my sister." or, "My sister doesn't even like you." It hurt a lot. Natalie was one of my best friends. I was one of her only friends because the other students weren't â€˜adjusted to her' yet. I was actually the first person who walked up to her on the first day of school that year. Anyway. Natalie repeatedly went to the counsler and Natalie, her sister, and I all went in once. This was halfway through the year and I couldn't take it anymore. The counselor sat us down and asked Natalie's sister why she liked bullying me so much. She replied with, "I don't know.." I didn't believe that, and the counselor didn't either. She asked her again and she replied with, "Because I don't want my sister to have friends!" That hurt me, a lot. After that Natalie's sister wouldn't look mw in the eyes again. The bullying stopped. I was a much happier kid. Natalie left the school to go to public school two years later but I still see her and keep in touch. Now I know to seek the counselor if something like that happened again.
