I had everything going for me; Being popular, funny, and desirable to the opposite sex. It was weeks after my 14 Birthday, and my supposedly best 'friend', turned all my other mates against me because he was jealousy of the above qualities I possessed. He had so much influence in the school, and barred any potential new friends interacting with me. I walked the halls like a ghost; the isolation period still haunts me to this very day.
 
The bullying went on for 2 and half years; violence, verbal abuse, isolation etc, and only stopped because I left. The Head Teacher nor the Head of Year did nothing. They just sat back and let me endure 30 months of, the only way to describe it is a "living hell".
 
That is 17 years ago; My life is a complete success now unlike the bullies; One got murdered, another is permanently unemployed, {edited.} and most of the others are just drifters in life who will never amount to anything.
