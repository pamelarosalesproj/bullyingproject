When I was about in the 2nd grade it seemed to start. 
I was sitting in class one day and these girls walk up to me and 
say, " why are you sitting alone? " I just tell them that hardly 
anyone wants to hang out with me. They start laughing and say 
mean things about me, which made me cry. Later on in 3rd grade 
those same girls told everyone not to hang out with me, I only had 
about 1 or 2 friends at the time, and it hurt. In 4th grade those 
girls acted a little nicer, but we're still rude.
 Even though I transferred they still make fun of me by 
calling me ugly,fat, annoying, and slow. I got really 
mad at that and I just snapped at them, but realized I 
became the bully. I learned that you really shouldn't 
listen to the people who hate you and just be yourself. 
Who cares if they don't like you for you, it's just how 
you act!
