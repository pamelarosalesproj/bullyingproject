When I started school I wasn't liked much. People said I was ugly. That was in just kindergarten.
When I went to 3rd grade it got worse. People called me fat, stupid, ugly, ect.
Then in 5th and 6th grade people called me the b word and kept telling me I was h**. 
I didn't even do anything to be called those. I'm not fast at answering math questions so the kids would
tease me and tell me that I should still be in 1st grade. One time a kid threw paper at me during our 
foods class. It said this "You're a mistake. You're parents wish you were dead. Guys hate you. 
You go around school like a s***. You think you're so hot. But you're not. You're just a fat stupid idiot who
should just {edited}." It really hurt my feelings and I started to believe it. One time I almost drank
{edited} when I was hanging out with friends. I went to go to the bathroom. Her bathroom has a 
cabinet with {edited} and stuff in it. So I grabbed the bottle open the cap then
My friend knocked on the door because I was taking so long. I told her I'd be out in a moment. She
knew about the note and all the bulling cause she was in all my classes. There was a secret was to unlock 
The door and she was afraid that I was gonna try to commit suicide so she unlocked it and took {edited}
away from me. She saved my life. Her and I went back to the room. We told the other girls about me 
trying to {edited} and the note. They told me I should tell my parents and the principal. I told my 
parents when I went home the next day and that Monday my parents took me to school and confronted
the principal about it. The principal called about 19 or 20 kids to the office because of the bulling and 
calling me names and teasing me. The teachers were brought into this. And it stopped for a while.
People still bully me but they don't do as severe things anymore. It's not bad to tell an adult. If you
don't it could get as bad as my problem was. Tell an adult if you're getting bullied
