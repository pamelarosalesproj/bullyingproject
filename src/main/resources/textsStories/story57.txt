When I first started 5th grade I didn't know anyone because I failed and everyone knew i failed 5th grade. Everybody thought it was funny to call me a "loser", a "failure in life", and lots of other mean things but I didn't really care. It started growing more and more; the name calling, the pushing.. Years passed and I was in the 8th grade. I was some what "popular" not because I was a mean girl or that I was the cheerleader captain, in fact, I wasn't in sports at all. I was popular because mainly I was nice, I gave people advice and did nice things for them. This girl thought it would be really cool if she made my life miserable. She started rumors about me and wrote things in the restrooms threatening me that she was going to beat me up. Even though she never did, she pushed me around told me things. I entered through this stage of depression and I started cutting myself and other things that made me feel bad. I did it to "to get rid of pain". I wanted school to finish so I can go to 9th and "start all over ", but I was wrong. When I started 9th grade, right away it was awful. I started cutting myself; I was in depression, anxiety and I had suicidal thoughts. There was a point where I just didn't wanted to to my English class because that's where everything happened. So instead I went to my friends class and I told her that I didn't want to go but she said "Look Ruby, I cant really do much but what I can do is be here for you we talk." I decided I would go to the counselor only if she went with me, so we did and the problem stopped. Thanks to my friend who now graduated and to GOD for giving me the strength I needed. Now I surrendered and I gave Him all my problems and he set me free of depression, anxiety, suicidal thoughts and everything else I was struggling with. Now I will wear my scars like badges of honor.
