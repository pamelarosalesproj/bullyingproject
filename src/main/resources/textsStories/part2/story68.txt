Well ever since I've been in second grade I was bullied. In first grade, I believed I was friends with everyone, and everyone liked me. But when I got in second grade, there was this one girl, she always said thinks like, "I so want to punch her in the face." And it was always when i was sitting there. My friends started to turn against me, my closest friend left in second grade. In third grade she came back and was in my class. This one girl was her friend too, but she always tried to turn her away from me. In third grade I lost most of my friends, I was down to a few. I remember all the insults and the comments. I remember one of my old friends telling me the 'Sticks and stones may break my bones but words will never hurt me' thing, she tried to make me repeat it, but I was in tears, I couldn't repeat, because it wasn't true. These words hit me harder than what I ever thought they could. The years pasted and i lost more and more friends, but I met one girl who cared for me, she was always there for me. On my way to middle school I thought I could make new friends, but I didn't, I only gained more enemies, they never gave me the time of day. The girl I met in elementary school, though, she stood by my side, and still does. I met some friends and we hang out all the time. Even if I get insults my friends are still there, they will never ditch me. I got a threat once but my friends where there to see me through it, they said they would protect me no matte what. It gets better no matter how bad it is now.
