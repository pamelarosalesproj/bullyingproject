 When I was in third grade my parents were going through hard times I wore my brothers old clothes...I didn't have the clothes that the girls in my school had so they just ignored me and I guess that was ok..it made me sad to know they didn't want to be my friend so they started this thing called Alexis  touch called me stupid tried to avoid me and talked about me behind my back...I moved schools and everything was ok for awhile..until we moved to Wisconsin and I started a new school they called me [Edited]...I'm quite skinny for my age...96 pounds so they called me anorexic and bulimic I tried not to let it bother me...they followed me home and screamed horrible things at me took my bike threw it in the street...when I was in 8th grade I got hit by a car while I was running across the street trying to get away from my bullies they laughed at me and when I came back to school they told me they wished I would have died and that I was a mistake and wrote names on my locker I moved to freshmen year and they found my locker and poured ink all over my stuff pushed me in the hallway took my food so I couldn't eat I started lashing out and getting angry...giving them a taste of there own medicine calling them the names that hurt me so much of course it didn't work...[ Edited Content] I moved schools again and got away from them...I'm still bullied by people my parents think its my fault I have no desire for anything anymore and I just feel so alone...like I have nobody it hurts so bad..I'm tired of the pain and im tired of hiding it my name is Alexis ...and I was bullied for 9 Years and still continue to be bullied today I want people to know my story so they know I'm still living through depression and I still have thoughts of suicide but I'm here...even tho sometimes I don't want to be.
