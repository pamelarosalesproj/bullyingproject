My name is Karissa.I am currently 17 years old and a Junior in High School. From the beginning, I knew I would be a different kind of girl when I entered high school. I wanted to b a different person from what I was in middle school. It all began my freshman year, I was bullied relentlessly and teased constantly. I was pushed into lockers, pushed down in the hallways, made fun of by nasty comments from people who walked past me. I would also get dirty looks from different people in class. It got worse my Sophomore year. Then now as a junior, I have attempted suicide and I was cutting for about 3 years. I never thought I would end up this way. It wasn't until my boyfriend Blake made me see the true meaning of life. He has helped me defeat the bullies and made me a stronger person. Am I still bullied today? Of course. But I don't let it bother me. I thank god everyday that I didn't decide to kill myself and now I have stopped cutting.
