Hello, my name is Janice. I been bullied since i started middle school which was 5 grade. the reason it start was cause someone started a rumor i liked this kid when i didn't. Everyone turned against me cause of it. I was the loner the out cast the loser of the grade. Then i moved for about 5 months then moved back. It was april when i came back. I made three friends by the end of 5 grade. 6 grade i ended up in same class as my friend Ryan. i was happy even though my two other friends were in different class. december came my birthday everyone even my friends ignored me cause of some girl start a ruin about me. People began to call me dirty names and stuff i became depressed and lost and alone. a few days before new years i ended up for first time selfharming. I dont understand why people do it it just hurts more. Ryan found out some how. He flipped out on me, but he ended up getting me help i need. If wasn't for him i dont know if i would be still around. the bullying keep going on. Then march 12 almost happen. I almost lost ryan. he was getting bullied too. he end telling me telling me he wanted to die. i remember crying and i remember i finally told him that i like him i told him i loved him. I ended up saving him by that. But few weeks layer. He got a girlfriend and the girl turned him against me i lost my best friend. The year ended. sumner came i got over depression. I began to love my self. School start 7 grade the grade im in right now i started to make friends i slowly getting ryan back and im happy. I found hope... Everything in end does turn out alright. There is always hope.
