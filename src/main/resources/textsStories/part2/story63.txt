My name is Lexie. I am a freshman in high school and have been bullied since elementary school. I have felt like I was all alone for as long as I can remember. My brother passed away when I was 11, I am 14 now. It has been a major struggle. I would burn myself as a way to release the pain. I had quit for a long time, but recently did it again. The day I burned myself was a bad day, I hadn't been bullied or anything, it was just a hard day. I  was suicidal for a long time. I have tried to tell the bullies  to leave me alone and eventually they did. I have a best friend who understands me when no one else does, her and my cousin who is my world essentially saved my life. It may be rainy now but eventually it gets better, it may not be today or tomorrow but it will! I am living, breathing proof! It will get better. Be proud of who you are and DO NOT let them get to you!
~Stay Strong! <3~
