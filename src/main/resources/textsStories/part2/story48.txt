Hello! First of all, I'm sorry if there are a few mistakes, I speak French. But I'm pretty good in English, as you can probably see. Anyway, my name's Justine, I'm fourteen and I live in Switzerland. Since I was little, my mom has been ill. She had lots of surgeries, she even had one two weeks ago. When I was six, my dad got the hepatitis C and was on medicine that made him angry and nervous. Because of all of this, I started to eat a lot and became fat. People started bullying me when I was about nine or ten. I got even fatter, because of the bullies. When I was eleven, my dad had a car accident and was in coma for a few months. I got fatter. When he was good again, he got a really grave disease, a septic shock. If you don't know what it its, it's a really grave blood infection. He was in coma for a few months again, but this time it was worse ; nobody knew if he was going to survive or not. I got fatter.
People stopped bullying me last year, but I still hear people laughing at me when I walk next to them. People say "don't listen to them". But that's just so easy to say! When you hear "you're worthless, fat, ugly" and more, you start believing it yourself. Even my siblings used to tell me I'm fat. I'm pretty proud I've never cut.
 
The final word to this is (be careful, cheesy quote coming), stay strong. Find a way to be more confident, find a friend who loves you for who you are. You can get through this, I know it. Even when everything seems to be horrible and wrong, just keep saying to yourself "I know I can do this, I'm stronger than them".
