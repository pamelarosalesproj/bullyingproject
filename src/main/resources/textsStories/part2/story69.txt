My names meghan. And im 14 years old. All my life, I been bullied. Non-stop. 1st grade to 9th grade. On a saturday, I was sleeping in. I got a call from a blocked number, calling me really awful names, & telling me that nobody wants me here. And for me to kill myself. I just let it go, I fell back to sleep.. I got another call, from retricted. Tellin me the same thing. I felt devasted. Everybody in that school thought i was the [edited]. i felt trashy, & embaresed. i ran down the hall, & out the door. I went back home, I missed 3 weeks of school. the bulying was bad. i checked my facebook, everybody was talking about me. I felt worthless & lonely. i tried to kill myself. i cut, & i took 15 pills. Nothing happend. when i went back to school, nothing changed. I walked the halls alone, & i had no friends. well,
> at lunch that day, this really rude girl threw my food in my face, I was fed up with it. I finally stood up for myself. I told her to back off, & shes no better then me. After that, nobody messed with me. I just had to stand up forself, & then. everybody left me alone. Im glad i didnt die, Because if i did, in wouldnt of got the chance to show everybody who i really am.
