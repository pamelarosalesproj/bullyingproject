here is my story. im Ashley  i was just in first grade like most people minding my own business when this group of people boys and girls. they have surrounded me and they started to push me around the group. i started to cry then they stopped. one of the girls started to call me names. i moved schools. the bullying started happening in 7th grade. these girls would follow me into the bathroom and call me names and hit me. i was so scared because i didn't know what they were going to do. so they started to kick me and hit me harder. i was still scared. so a teacher walked in the stop it. she heard me screaming. all i wanted to do was lay there and die. they had got suspended and i was hoping it would stop. i was walking home one day and the girl had followed me home. they pulled me in an alley and beat me up so bad i was in the hopital with broken ribs and a broken nose. i was scared that they was going to do it again. in 8th grade was bad to. i was beat up almost everyday. i was called alot of names [edited] etc. i was so hurt. i was starting to cut myself again. i couldn't handle it. i was so scared. 8th grade was my worst year. last year, the same girls beat me up again and called me names. i wanted to die. i thought about it but i didnt want to. im in 10th grade now, most of the bullying have stopped. im at a new school now. im am still getting made fun of though. But not as bad as it was. I still scared that one day im going to get jumped. That's my story. You should tell yours.
