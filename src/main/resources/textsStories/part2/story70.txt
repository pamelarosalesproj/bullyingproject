Hello this is my bullying story and its recently 
happening. It's not a major bullying problem but I 
thought people should know. Well ill be honest I did 
used to bully people. But I would be like hey shorty. 
Nothing too bad. And you might say this is karma. Well 
just last night I told my followers on instagram and 
twitter to ask me questions, on ask.fm . And these are 
the things I got (the bottom small font is my replies) 



I didn't know that people hated me. I cried on and off. And I talked to like two people about it. One said just ignore them. Like the usual person would say to someone in my situation. The other person said delete your account on ask.fm . But I thought maybe I shouldn't. Later that night I used the screen shots above and posted it on my instagram account . Gosh I love my followers on instagram. It couldn't have been any of them, they treat me like a goddess. The comments were amazing. They said things like " oh don't listen to them." " that's why there anonymous and they can't say it to your face" and they even went on my ask and said nice things like I'm perfect and I'm amazing. But I don't believe it they scared me. I know it's not that bad of a bully story but I thought people should know. If anybody ever reads or listen to what I have to say . Well thanks anyway for reading this :)
