Im Destiny When I was around 10/11do to a little family issues I had to live with my dad for a month I had to go to school still so the schools were different  from Hollywood the kids would call me names and treat me bad cause I came from and was born in Hollywood. I didn't know why they were being so mean so every day I would come home crying not knowing why no one wanted to be friends with me  And no one would really give me a chance to actually see that I'm just like them and there nothing really different. Now I'm 18 iv learned to never treat a person bad and always get to see who they are and not just judge by we're they come from or look like. Iv also learned yo stand up for my self and be the bigger person in a bullying situation and to help anyone in that kind of situation. No person on earth deserves to be bullied no matter what it's not right
