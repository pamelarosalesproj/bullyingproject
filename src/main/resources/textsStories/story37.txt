Hi, my name is Gerrika and I am 14 years old and in the 8th grade. I have been bullied constantly throughout my life. But it all got worse in 8th grade. When I came to school one day my best friend came up to me, looking worried and scared. I asked her what was wrong and a tear went down her cheek. She took out her iPad and showed me some pictures. Some person decided that it would be funny to start a Facebook paged called "Gerrika The S---" and acting like he/she was me. It got around and everyone was saying "Aww there goes the girl that that happened to." They felt sorry for me. I hate it when people feel sorry for me. I wanted it to go away. So I ignored it. But then people were saying that I was the one doing it. They said I was just trying to get attention. But really. Do you think I wanted this? Do you think I wanted everyone to feel sorry for me? But people were sticking up for me. I really want to stop bullying; physically, verbally, and cyber. Please stop. No one deserves this. No one. <3
