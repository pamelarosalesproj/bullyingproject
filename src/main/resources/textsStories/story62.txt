My name is kayla and ever since I started school I was bullied in the little school it was physical I was punched, kicked this happened everyday by a boy until one day one lad stuck up for me and hit him back when he saw what was going on. It later stopped n the boy who hit me got moved schools. I later left the school to then go to high school yeah 7 It was fine for a few months until one day a lad told me I looked like a monkey his friends told everyone and most of that year I was called monkey I gotten into year 8 and it started up again I was called monkey face by everyone it hurt me and I cried and ran from school home I would everyday run home until my mom stopped me going for a couple of weeks my head teacher told my mom she had to bring me in. The didn't do anything just gave me a bully book and told me to write everything down they didn't want to know. In year 9 it got so bad I didn't want to be there I wanted to move but my mom didn't want me to move so I stopped there I had it all the way to I was in year 11 I was sixteen and a teacher stopped it for me at last she called the bullies in and told them if they carried on they would get my parents in and they could tell my parents why they thought it was good to bully me. I'm now 21 and my words are don't let them bring you down stay strong its hard I know but stay strong because it gets easier and you will come out on top.
