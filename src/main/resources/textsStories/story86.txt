When I was in about fourth grade, it was my first time I ever got bullied. A girl came up to me and out of nowhere just said "You're stupid and ugly. You don't even belong at this school.". That's where it all began. That was pretty much the only time in fourth grade I got bullied. Now, lets move on to fifth grade. That's where the big floods of bullying came. People came up to me almost daily calling me ugly. I used to wear a lot of makeup because I, also, believed I was ugly, and because of that, a girl would always call me ugly and stupid for piling tons of makeup on my face. People would call me ugly all of the time, and also, sometimes they would call me fat. Then in sixth grade, it sort of died down a little, because I didn't wear as much makeup. And last year, in seventh grade, this boy would call me ugly all the time and tell me every day I was annoying, when I didn't even talk to him at all. When I didn't hear about him saying rude things about me, he'd be behind my back talking about me. He got a lot of his friends to go after me and call me ugly. I've also been called emo and gothic because of the music I listen to and the way that I sometimes dress. I haven't yet really told an adult, but I know that I should. I've told many friends, one being one of my bully's cousins. I've also had bullies in kindergarten who would throw rocks at me and at my bike tires when I would be riding my bike. One of them recently passed away, so R.I.P to him, and I've also recently met up with one of them, who sincerely apologized for it. Another time I was bullied, someone threw a baseball at my leg and left a big, round welt, and twisted one of my friends' thumbs and made her bleed. I've also been bullied by being swung around by my hair and thrown to the ground.
I'm going to be telling an adult the next time I'm bullied. I just thought this was a much easier way to get it out for now. Thank you for listening to my story.
