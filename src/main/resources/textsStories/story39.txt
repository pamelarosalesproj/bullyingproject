As you can most likely tell, I have a weird name. I don't even know why I have this stupid name with a even stupider last name, but I am stuck with it. At school I was called Apple. They said that they would feed on me and pushed me around. Then one day someone dared a classmate of mine to bite me, and they did. I still have the scar. I was really mad so I ran home crying. I started skipping school, pretending to go, until my parents found out. They were mad and asked me why. I didn't think they would understand so I just said the homework was too much. They just said they would help me. I went back to school and people were whispering about me. I had no idea what until I over heard the TEACHERS talking about it. I was really sad. They said that I had a mental and physical problem and I should be sent to a "special school". People said I hit and bit people. I was desperate for a solution. I planned to kill my self when a girl in my class said hi to me. I thought she was teasing me. Turns out, she was being insulted too. I wasn't the only one. She talked to me and then the next day, she committed suicide. I was mad. I went home and told my parents my issue. They listened and understood, since they had similar issues. My parents said that we were going to move soon, but before we did, she went to my school. I was really embarrassed until she said to everyone: "everyone is different, and having a special name is the unique part of someone, it doesn't mean that we are strange, it means we are special". Everyone was silent and we marched out. I am just giving my advice. I don't want you to suffer depression too. Tell someone. Don't commit suicide, because then, the bullies win.
