It was when I moved to secondary school that it all started.

Everything was fine until about halfway through my first year. This boy that went to my old school started calling me 'mogly', after a gremlin. He got most of the other boys to join in. I told the heads of year and they stopped it for a while, but then the boys bullied me for telling of them.

Later on in the year I got new school shoes. One of my supposed 'friends' laughed at them and teased me about them. I almost cried because I thought she was my friend.

I am now at the end of my 1st year and everything has turned out fine. NEVER BULLY!
