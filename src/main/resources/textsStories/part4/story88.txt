When I was in 7th grade I was about to move but in a few months and i got along really well with a lot of people. But when people found out they started whispering behind my back, I didn't notice at first  but then i heard a few guys whom I thought were my friends saying they were  glad i was moving. . . It really hurt and i didn't know what to do so I started cutting and when my friends found out they told the guidance counselor who told my parents. But the thing is my parents didn't care they told me to stop faking, and the fact that my parents didn't believe me is what made me suicidal. Nothing really helped until I moved and I wasn't bullied anymore but my parents still don't care and that bothers me but I'm no longer thinking that way or cutting.
