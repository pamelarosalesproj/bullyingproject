Hi. My name is Amanda. This story is not about me, but about my friend, David. Him and I would be babysat together when I was four. Since my mom worked nearby where they lived, she would let me stay there. After a while, David and I soon forgot about each other, and moved on with our lives. Little did I know horrible things were happening to him.After eight years, at a doctor's appointment, my mother asked me a question that would stay in my heart forever." Do you want to go to a funeral on Saturday?" I looked at her funny, and replied," For one of your friends?" She looked at me sad and replied, " For yours." I was shocked." Which friend?" I asked." David." At first, I had no clue who she was talking about. After showing me a picture of us together, it all started coming back. I asked her how he died.David was bullied at school by many people. Everyone knew, including some staff, but didn't do anything. Even worse, at home, he was beaten physically be his father. Still, the mother didn't do anything. I only wish I could've been there to help him through. Sadly, on Valentine's Day, David took his life by hanging himself. All I hope is that the people who read this, don't stand by, knowing someone is getting hurt constantly, because you could be the difference between life and death.
