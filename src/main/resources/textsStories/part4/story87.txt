When I was in Year 4 (3rd Grade), I joined a new school, everyone instantly became my frined, and I had grown an interest in a particular boy I sat next to. In Year 7 (6th Grade), I still liked him, and in Year 5 (4th Grade), I had told my friend about it; we fell out in Year 6 (5th Grade).
In Year 7, she had told everyone, even the boy himself, and it caused me to cry even more and more than usual.
But then things got personal; she started bullying my best friend, Sara, and I had to stick up for her.
I went up to the bully and punched her in the face. What else were I to do? She got up tried punching me, but I stopped her and kneed her in the gut. She had done so too, in previous years, and hit me a lot, so I had to stick up for my self. She then said "What do you think you're doing?" So I responded, as of her flat nose, "Sorry, did I hurt you, Voldemort?" And everyone around me applauded me, I felt proud.
A couple of days later, I had been called to the headteacher's office, and got a detention for kneeing her. She never let me explain what happened.
The point is, it's good to stick up for yourself, but maybe do it verbally, not physically; and it's also better to tell someone about your situation before the fighting and standing up for yourself. ;)
I needed to protect my best friend, any good friend would, but I should have told a teacher or authoritive adult.
