One time when I was in the car with my mom and sister, all the kids from school were coming out. We were just getting out of the school zone, when there was two boys walking on the sidewalk. All of a sudden, the one boy just pushed the other into the road. My mom beeped and had to step on the breaks to avoid an accident. Since I was in the car, I couldn't do much but I was so shocked that kids would push other kids into busy traffic. Bullying is a very big problem, and I think it should end. I hope they enforce laws that it won't be tolerated if you're caught in action.
