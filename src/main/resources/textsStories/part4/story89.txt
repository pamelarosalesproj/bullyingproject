When I was 10 years old,I was a huge fan of a website.I always went on it everyday.I had 4 guys as my best friends on there. One of the four started saying mean things to me.He called me a Boy a gold digger.Even more things That were a bit inappropriate.And more.He even said things like "If you suicide,I would be very happy." "Go to hell" "I bet you are actually A Boy". I had no one there to help me.The boy was no longer my best friend.My 3 other best friends wouldn't help me.They were his friend too. A few weeks later.One of my 3 best friends Became the bully too.He said things like "I hate her!" "She's ugly" "You have fat cheeks" (He saw my face in real).The 2 boys threatened to Tell on my parents.A month later,I found out One of my 2 best friends was with the first bully.I realized I only had one Best friend there for me,But some of the time he would not do much.I did my best to keep from feeling depressed Like Calling "Kids Help Phone" But they wouldn't help much,Saying just to ignore. I felt depressed,And alone. I lost my 3 best friends. I stood up for myself,But I still felt depressed.
