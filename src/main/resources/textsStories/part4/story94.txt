When I was younger, being on stage was something I enjoyed. When my mom told me that there was a play and tryouts were the upcoming week, I was extremely excited. My mom drove me over to the tryouts, and I saw that there were lots of kids who wanted to be in the play. When they told me I made it I was full of joy. I couldn't stop thinking how much fun this would be.
 
  On the first day I realized there were a group of four girls, and the "leader" of it was this one girl, we can call her T. At first 'T' seemed kinda nice, but then things suddenly turned around. She started making up lies, rumors and calling me names which made me cry. They took all my joy away from me. There was a girl who couldn't stand this bully. She and I promised eachother that we would tell the director about this problem. When I was looking for her, she was making fun of me secretly with the mean girls. I tried to tell the director, but all he said was "kids will be kids, just ignore them." I had to tell a parent who listened, and they helped. You know the saying "sticks and stone may break my bones, but names will never hurt me"? People say that, but the words are the ones that can hurt the most. I learned that bullies will just try to break you down and make you feel bad about yourself, but they're just doing that to make themselves feel better. Bullying is NEVER good in any way. Even to this day, I'm still slightly bullied. Every now and then someone will try to tear my spirit apart... but I know that you should just ignore it because after a while they'll just give up.    
  If you're a bully, just think how the other person might feel. And if you're a victim, just tell someone that can help.
