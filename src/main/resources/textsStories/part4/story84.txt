 i have two stories i wanted to share with your website.

 first was about a boy named ezra in my seventh grade history class.  he was pretty immature and always acting kinda weird.  whenever he talked someone would scream to shut up.  or say really mean things.  'go die in a hole!'  ' no one likes you!'  and now i regret that i would never stand up to the other kids.  also there was a time when i was bullied.  one year in middle school a girl named Kendell gutner bullied me.  i ended up going out with a boy she had once dated and still liked.  she when around saying really bad stuff about me and spreading rumors.  she would text the boy how she was going to kill me and how i was not good enough.  one day my art teacher heard me talking about this to one of my friends and told the guidance counselor.  we had a talk and i lied and said that i was exaggerating.  i didn't want to cause more trouble.  the next year we actually became friends.  but i  just think that that shows how anyone can do it.  even those who seem to be the nicest of people. 
 p.s my name is megan.
