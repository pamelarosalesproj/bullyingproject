I NEVER told anyone my story except 2 of my best friends. They were with me threw the past couple of years. They said why i wouldnt tell a teacher, Guidence, Or a trusted adult. I mean it was 2 much nobody knew what i was going threw. One day that girl that called me [edited] I went into the woods and started to cut right their i just wanted my life to be over intill matt called and he helped me work everything out.
