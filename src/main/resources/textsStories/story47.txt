It all started when I was 8. My group of friends started to bully me. I tried to stand up for myself and kicked the leader of the bullies. It stopped her but the other bullies carried on. So I was put in to a friendship group with them which didn't help at all. When I was 9 we all moved up to the local middle school. I thought it would be a fresh start. But it wasn't. They continued to bully me by beating me up on the way to school, calling me names and talking about me behind my back, spreading rumours around my year. My teachers started to get suspicious. I was 12 when I eventually told my friends who then told my most trusted teacher. I told her what they were doing to me and it was sorted. It took me another 6 months to tell my friends the whole story and that I lived with depression for 3 years and am still living with it. I am currently being counselled for my bullying in school by my teachers and have told most of my friends about the bullying, depression and counselling. Please don't become a bully it destroyed my life. I was bullied for 5 years but it doesn't just stop when the bullying stops. It lasts a lifetime!
