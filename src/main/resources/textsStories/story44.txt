I am 17 now. It has been a little over a year since my bully, Chris, left my school. This is my battle and how I won.
It started when I first enrolled to Gateway. The "bullies" wanted me to join them, but I gave them a firm no when they asked about it. I told them I wanted to hang out with the "nerds" and such; so as the days went on, they kept treating me like junk, like I was subhuman. If any of you have ever been treated like that, then you'll understand me more.
These "bullies" would leave my school, and Chris would only remain. At that point, it wasn't bad, like I wasn't cutting because I knew I would have to look at scars and plus, I have a very strong willpower.
At a certain point in my interactions with him, I found him on FB and tried to apologize for being mean to him and for stealing his crush, but he sent back a message with the words "SCREW YOU" on it. I have since been trying to get him to talk to me. I have learned a few things from this altercation: 1. Ignorance of the bully really won't help in the big stream of things, 2. You must stand up to your oppressors (bully(ies) and tell them that your not going to talk to them, and that if they want to stop, they'll need to talk with you.
The biggest lesson is that I learned that Chris was just an over-hyped man who hid behind his words and never stood for them which was lucky for me. I also had the help of God. He gave me the willpower and strength to be able to overcome this menace and to be able to forgive Chris. I'm sorry if this is a little bit long, but I feel relived that it's out-there. Remember: Do your best and let Jesus do the rest.
