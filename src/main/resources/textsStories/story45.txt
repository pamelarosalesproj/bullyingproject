I remember when i used to get bullied. It all started in 5th grade with my so called "best friend". I actually thought she was my friend, i trusted her, & i told her personal stuff. Turns out she wasn't she ended up telling people my business, made lies & rumors about me, she called me names & turned everyone against me. She always denied the stuff she said. A few months later it stopped she apologized and i said it was fine. She said she wasn't going to bully me anymore & i believed her. Than like a month later Turns out that she made fun of me & everything behind my back. She also  cyberbullied me on social networks such as Facebook. She wrote bad stuff about me & everyone at school saw. They all made fun of me. All the things she did or said made me cry . I always kept it to myself, my parents didn't know. I than started cutting & thought about committing suicide. My life had become so hard. I felt to much pain that my only solution to that was suicide. I honestly never thought i was going to get through this. School noticed how i started to change so they made me talk to a counselor. I told her what was happening. It turned out to go really well, it helped. the counselor told my parents, my mom cried because she didn't know this was happening. After that stuff got a little better I stood up for myself instead of doing nothing about it & she stopped. Bullying is something that people should prevent from happening. We've lost many people because of this and it's honestly sad because people don't know how much it hurts. My advice is to tell someone don't keep quiet speak up & stay strong because if i did it you can do it don't let no one, no one bring you down.
