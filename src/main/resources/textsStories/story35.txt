Well it all started in year 7, I told one of my best friends Something very personal and then the next day it was all over the school
They would make fun of me for it call me Names and Sometimes hit me I would go home a cry I told NOBODY! I was so Upset about it It came to the point where I had no friends I would Hide myself away And  I would just Hate school I skipped most of it because of this Bullying I would not talk to anybody I stopped eating I got really ill I started being sick going dizzy and it came to the point where I fainted and went to hospital I fainted when I was Outside I wacked my head of the Pavement Cracking it open I lost quite abit of blood
I got Bullied for My Hobbies Art & Singing and for Liking Dinsey Etc ...  But it didn't end there I moved to Essex's 2 weeks later Everybody hated me bullied me I cut myself and I tried to Hang myself one time My brother stopped me And I finally told him everything My
Mum and dad Went down to the school and Started Telling the head teacher everything  Now I go to a really good School I stand up to Bullys
And sometimes I even help people get threw hard times
I know it must be tuff but tell someone It will make your life a Hole lot better
