My name is Beth. I was bullied since
 Age 8. It all started in 2nd grade. I was the friendliest girl, and my "BFF" , Meghan, started showing me bad things and I told her to stop. She turned all the boys against me, even my boyfriend, Kaleb. Then I moved in 4th grade. I wanted a better life. I expected this new school to work wonders on my life. All I got was BAD. This girl, whom her name is Maddie, she bullied me. Badly. In 4th and 5th grades, she turned everyone against me. Then acted my friend, then called me overweight fat cow and idiot and stupid. The counselor told me to stop lying about this "precious angel". In fact, everyone said Maddie was the best one ever. I got the best grades. Even my pressuring teacher said that. But it wasn't good enough. I said to Maddie that I wanted to kill myself. Her reply: GOOD!! Then she got everyone to chant,"Let's kill Beth! Let's kill Beth!" My new nickname was Fatty Patty Fatterson. I was going to kill myself when my Mum and Daddy moved us to a better school. I have the occasional meanie, but I get over it. I have SOOOO many friends i can't even count now.I am so happy now!!
