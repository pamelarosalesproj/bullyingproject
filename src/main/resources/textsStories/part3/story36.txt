i have been bullied since i was young. on my first day of kindergarten i came home with a black eye crying because i got punched in the face by a 2nd grader. In first grade i was called a loser because i had a hard time making friends and because i was short. in second grade it got worse! i was bigger then the other kids and i was "FAT" kids gave me nicknames like "Big Fat Loser" and "Chubby" .  and year by year day by day hour by hour the taunting got worse. But I learned to deal with it. the first time i spoke up i was so glad i did! im still emotionally scared  by those experiences. and now see a therapist every week. i learned that bulling can make a person die inside. if your a bully STOP THE HATRED YOU ARE CAUSING. my bulling got so bad one time i tried to hurt my self. just remember that god loves you and if you ignore the bully and tell someone it will stop. trust me it worked for me.
