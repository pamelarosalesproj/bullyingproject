It feels weird that something so small can affect you so greatly. I have had a pretty good life by economic standards, but when it comes to emotional I had it bad. I think it all started in second grade, that was when I got fat and I mean FAT. At first it was little mean things, taking my lunch because "your too fat to eat" or the constant cries of
"ewwwww" and "fatlard" in P.E. I was only in second grade! Things got worse as the year went along. I had no friends. None. The kids played a game called "get away" it involved them trying to get as far away from me as possible. Then the worst thing happened, I was physically pushed and shoved back and forth while changing for P.E. By this time I was in fourth grade and i understood that this was not right, but how could I stand up for myself? I convinced myself it was nothing and carried on with my life. One day in fifth grade a teacher noticed the new girl punch me and told the school councilor. I'm going to make this part short. There was crying, hurt feelings, and alot of apologies. After that there was sixth grade, nothing had changed so I left. I am now at a new school, and I love it, I have learned to brush off the occasional "chipmunk cheek" and other mean things. That is my story that i have told everyone, now here is what only I know. Throughout the years of my bullying I got depresses. I tried to kill myself at age 10. I cut my wrists. I stopped eating. I stopped laughing. My life was never the same. I don't want this to happen to anybody. That is why I wrote this, SPEAK UP! Nothing is going to change if you don't. Stay strong.
