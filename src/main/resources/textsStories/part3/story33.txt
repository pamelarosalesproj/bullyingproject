I was severely bullied and beaten up in middle school,particularly in grades 6 and 8 because I was weird and annoying to others . The physical bullying was reduced in 9th grade (to stealing and destroying my properties) . In 10th grade the bullying became more physical with punches in my arm almost everyday(sometimes,if not always I riposted and stand up to myself). In grade 11 I began to be myself a bully(still,I was picked on constantly in this year by a tall guy) and I constantly beat up and picked on two of my classmates(one of them for many reasons,including vengeance,and the other because he was pissing me off with his unstable behavior) but in 12th grade I became calm(I'm 18 now).I even know why I became a bully in a prompt way,because all the years and struggles I have been through made me for a serious yet a small period of my life a monster searching for revenge on my old bullies and I wanted to rebuild my self esteem(wich was ruined by the age of 12).I am still bullied now I can tell but it is rare and verbal bullying(very rare phisically,because some types of bullying have age limits and punching someone in the face when you're legally an adult is considerate a crime and punished by law).
