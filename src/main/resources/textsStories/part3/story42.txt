Hi my name is Alexis. I've been threw so much in the last year with bullies. I've been bullied in person,cyber bullied and I've seen people be bullied. I'm a freshmen for the second time this year. Last year I was bullied for all different kind of reasons. I was bullied on the people I hung out with. If I didn't hang out with the "cool" kids I was made fun of. I was told that I was worthless. I've had people get in my face and scream at me. But the one thing that I did that I didn't read in any other stories is I stood up for myself.. I told them what they needed to hear. At first this kid was my best friend and he started bullying me. He called me so many inappropriate names, when we were best friends before he started bullying me he told me he would never hit a girl. I didn't. He got multiple girls to surround me on my way to lunch. I told them that they need to get out of my way and that them surrounding me was the "uncoolest" thing they can do! After that I completely ignored them. I was still bullied but not as much. When I moved everyone realized that when we were friends I was always there for them I got calls from people apologizing and with some of them I'm  closer than ever!
I think sticking up for yourself is the best thing you can do because it shows the bully that your not afraid of them.
Whenever I see a kid getting bullied I always stick up for them, because I know what it is like to be called inappropriate names like that. I know what it feel like I would do anything to help them because I don't think anyone should have to go threw being bullied!
