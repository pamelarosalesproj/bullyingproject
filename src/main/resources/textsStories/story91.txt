When I when I was in 3rd grade, I started getting bullied. I was called shortie. I was bullied, kicked, punched and laughed at. I didn't do anything back. I didn't want to get in trouble, so I just told my mother. She told the principal to stop this child from hurting me. But, I was still bullied and had to got to another school. Now I am 6th grade, trying to stand strong. I don't cut, but I was close to trying to hurt myself in another way. But I decided not too. I am still a victim of being bullied, but I'm stronger.
