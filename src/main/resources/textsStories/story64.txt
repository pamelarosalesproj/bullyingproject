Hi, my name is Nyquiah. I have been teased all my life. I've been called everything from fat to ugly to worthless. But it wasn't until 10th grade that the teasing reach a new level. When I was in 10th grade, I switched schools. It was fine the first few months, but then I was befriended by this girl in my woodshop class. We were close, laughing and acting like best friends. Well, one day, she basically turned on me. Out of nowhere. She went and told her cousin and another one of their friends. It was horrible. I can't count the times I went to the guidance office. It got to the point where I couldn't even take the main hall to class. I had to take the breezeway (outside hallway). They followed me to class, said things about me, and everything else. I had class with one of the girls, her cousin ride my bus, and I had lunch with ALL THREE OF THEM. I don't care where I went, I always ran into one of them. I had always loved school, but I hated it at this point. My grades had dropped tremendously. I cried every morning and night. I would get on the bus and just keep my head down because one of the girls sat in the first seat and she always said something to me. There was this one girl... She was the worst one. She was a bit more outspoken and agressive than they were. So she was the one who did the "dirty work". I had one 2 friends who stuck with me through it all. I'm so grateful for them. As for the girls, I don't know what happened to them. 2 of them graduated, and the other one quit school. I'm over it, but the memories and scars are still there. I might forget what they did, and I might forget what they said... But I will NEVER forget how they made me feel.
