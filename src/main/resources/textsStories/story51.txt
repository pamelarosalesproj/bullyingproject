Freshman year, the start of high school, the start of a teens best four years of their life. I was a girl who was excited to start school, I wanted high school to come especially coming from just a tiny grade school where I graduated with 8 kids. The beginning of the year started great, I had my solid group of friends, I felt like I would never be a statistic about bullying. In fact that was my last worry in the world. Then came October; my class had just over 100 kids and was super cliquey. I was never part of the popular group because I wasn't a girl who liked to go out and party. One just normal October night I was sitting in my room like i do every night trying to get homework done when I got a random message on Facebook saying that I shouldn't be talking about people until I truly get to know the person first. I was really confused but me being me I just replied back "ok thanks". I was still confused about the whole thing so I immediately sent out a group message to at the time my 3 closest friends just asking them if they had heard anything. Then my nightmare became a reality there was a rumor going around that I had called all the girls in my class wh***s. I was shocked when I heard this. I started to dread the next day at school because I was scared of what was going to happen. I showed up at school that day and went through the worst day of school. Kids would make comments about it all day. I was constantly confronted by girls just being girls. That day started the downward spiral of my freshman year. After that more things were said about me, it got brought to Twitter fights, I would see these girls outside of school and they would say anything to get me down. I would walk to me locker in the morning and have kids crowding it talking and laughing at me. When I thought it couldn't get any worse, I went to my locker one day after school to get my stuff because I had basketball practice after school. I opened my locker to find 72 notecards numbered and all had one word on them. I decided I wasn't gonna put it all together right then in there otherwise I would be late so I shoved it in my back pack and headed to the locker room. Thankfully practice took my mind off of it. That night when I got home I went up to my room just like routine to do homework. I opened my back pack to find the notecards that I had forgotten about. I decided it was time to put it all together and decode the message. To summarize it all up it mainly said "you f****** b****" "No one wants you at our school" "Boo you wh*** go die". This was the first night my parents found out about the bullying. At this point I had no friends left, I didn't have anyone to talk too and I pretty much just shut down. I started to think that the world would just be a better place without me. My friends didn't want a thing to do with me because they just thought I brought drama with me everywhere. I stopped eating, I started to self harm and I even started to write my not to my family explaining to all and why I committed suicide. I ended up turning to music and thinking about everything in life that I still had before me. I honestly never turned to real true help. All of it still haunts me today but I have learned from it. Today I am a sophomore I transferred out of that school and I have never been more happy in my life. I learned that it was never me it was those kids because where I'm at now I am friends with everyone. I'm part of many activities, I have formed close relationships with anyone I can, I am in a current relationship with someone who has never made me happier and I am just loving life and the rest of the time I have in high school just like I'm supposed too.
