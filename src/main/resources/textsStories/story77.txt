My name is Lizzy. I've been bullied since kindergarten. Relentless teasing, pushing, punching... I was afraid to tell anyone, afraid that it would get worse. I knew adults saw, but they refused to acknowledge that those students were doing what they were to me. I was terrified to go to school, terrified of walking home... it was awful. I'm proud to say that for the last year I've been bully free, and I've started to speak against any bullies I see. I've made it my mission to raise awareness and to help those going through what I did. So kids, fight back. Don't give up. Remember, just because they don't see you as a wonderful person doesn't mean you aren't one. That is your choice.
