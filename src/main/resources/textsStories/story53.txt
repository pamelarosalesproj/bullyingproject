hi,
i've been bullied in the past and i want to share my story with others...
it all started when i skipped a year at school,the 3th year.
all the suddent there was a guy who treated me as if i'm just like nothing.
i've let him do what he did and things got worse.
he was threatening me with a knife,i got really bad nightmares of him killing me and allso he stabbed me with a pencil.the point of the pencil never got out totally.
and that was just the start,since then evryone ignored me.
i had like 2 friends that helped me kick their buts when they attacked me.
mostly we won but there was one time they've allmost assphyxiated me.
now it's going lots better and that's why i tell this story.
i'm proud of what i've become becouse of him.
when you're bullied it might seem like there is no way out but believe me,
THERE IS ALLWAYS LIGHT AT THE END OF A DARK TUNNEL!!!
you have to keep believing that!
i hope this helped for the people might be looking at this!
bye!
