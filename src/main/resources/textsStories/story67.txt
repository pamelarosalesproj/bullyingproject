My name is Briley and I'm 13 years old. I've been bullied ever 
since I could remember. Everyone at my school bullies me, I get 
called "Midgit" because I'm short. [edited]
They bully me and call me names everyday. I had this one friend,
who I actually thought was my friend until she started beating 
me :( . She hits me everywhere, she bullies me, she shoves me,
 and sometimes when I sit down she forces my head down to the 
seat. I haven't really told anybody yet because I'm afraid if 
I do she'll hit me even more !! And there used to be this one 
girl on my bus last year who would hit me and yank my hair, 
one time the bus had turned and I had fell out of my seat and 
onto the floor and she grabbed and handful of my hair and 
yanked me up off the ground and back into by seat. 
Her bullying had gotten worse over the next month. 
One day we were riding the bus when she claimed that I hit 
her with my umbrella (which I didn't) so she beat me with my 
umbrella, grabbed a fistful of my hair and kept yanking and 
pulling it while she called me a stupid [edit]. My bus driver 
never did anything about it. I called my mom crying me eyes 
out because of what that girl did. That was the day I decided 
I had finally had enough of her bullying. I filed a bully 
report against her and I almost got a restraining order on 
her too. I know my story isn't as bad as everyone else's on 
here but it's still a bullying story and its nice to get it 
all out :)
