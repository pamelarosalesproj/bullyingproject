  In the fifth grade(I was 10 years old at the time) I had a bully.He just started physically bullying me for no reason. He would ram his leg into my knee and pull my hair and push me up against the cubbies(little elementary school lockers) It was at the same time everyday, 2:30. I was always terrified, sometimes I didnt want to come to school. I had a bruise for a whole year on my leg the size of a volleyball!
    In sixth grade the 8th graders started pushing my books to the ground and pushing me into my locker, along with the knee ramming and the hair pulling from my other bully. I felt like I didnt fit in until an 8th grader saw what people were doing to me and confronted them about it. I remember: "Stop! Just Stop bullying this girl. She doesnt deserve it! What if someone did that to you? Now go before I tell the principal." He helped me up. "Are you okay?" He asked. "Yeah, I'll be fine." I said. Him and I (even though he is in high school now) are very good friends. We keep in touch. he took me to the principal's office to tell an adult. He knew exactly who those kids are. That boy is a life saver! If it weren't for him I would've probably gotten it even worse.
