Hi my name is victoria,
When I was in year 3 I got bullied for my skin colour. I 
had 1 best friend called darcey but eventually turned on 
me to go on my bully side I ignored it everyday.
In class I would get told off for every little thing I 
would get detention as well. Soon they said things like 
u can't run and u can't hide so might as well get on ur 
knees and pray to us. In year 4 it I then told my mum 
that they kept kicking me. My mum and aunty were very 
supportive and said tell the teacher so I did but 
nothing happened the just said I was telling tales, I 
told my mum and aunty again and they said if they kicked 
u kick them back but I was scared I didn't want to get 
in trouble after that my mum asked If I wanted to move 
schools so I did now I have 2 best friends called alicia
we born same day and holly.
